# Weather-prediction
this is a hidden markov machine learning model that predicts weather using probabilities of past events
We will model a simple weather system and try to predict the temperature on each day given the following information.
Cold days are encoded by a 0 and hot days are encoded by a 1.
The first day in our sequence has an 80% chance of being cold.
A cold day has a 30% chance of being followed by a hot day.
A hot day has a 20% chance of being followed by a cold day.
On each day the temperature is normally distributed with mean and standard deviation 0 and 5 on a cold day and mean and standard deviation 15 and 10 on a hot day.
